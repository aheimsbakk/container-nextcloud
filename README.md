# Nextcloud Apache container with ffmpeg

Added missing `ffmpeg` library for getting thumbnails on movies. This image is built on [my page on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/aheimsbakk).

Image is built daily, and it's expected that you start it with environment variable `NEXTCLOUD_UPDATE=1`.

See the original [Nextcloud](https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud) container environment variable options.
